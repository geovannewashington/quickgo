A package clause starts every source file.
main is a special name declaring an executable rather than a library.
So if a go file starts with `package main` it means it's suppose to be compiled into a standalone program
It must have a main function inside (which will be the entry point) of the application.

if, on the other hand, we have `package` followed by any other name, you're defining a library (or package)
that provides functions, types, etc (like `fmt`). To be used by other code. It cannot be compiled
and won't contain a main() function.

```go
package main
```
