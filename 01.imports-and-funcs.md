A package clause starts every source file.
main is a special name declaring an executable rather than a library.
So if a go file starts with `package main` it means it's suppose to be compiled into a standalone program
It must have a main function inside (which will be the entry point) of the application.

if, on the other hand, we have `package` followed by any other name, you're defining a library (or package)
that provides functions, types, etc (like `fmt`). To be used by other code. It cannot be compiled
and won't contain a main() function.

```go
package main
```

Import declarations declares library packages referenced by this file.

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "io"
    m "math"
    "net/http"
    "os"
    "strconv"
)
```

Note that if you're only importing a single package you can ommit the parentheses: `import "fmt"`.
Note also that we're importing the math package using an alias. See one example below:

```go
package main

import (
    f "fmt" // aliasing fmt as "f"
)

func main() {
    // this is totally valid.
    f.Println("Hello from fmt using alias!")
}
```

## About Functions:

As I already mentioned, the main function is a special function, just like in C/C++ it's the main
entry point for the program.

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!");
    // Note that Println is a function that comes from the fmt (format) lib, a lib for formatting output.
    // Note also that fmt.Print() also exists, the difference is that is does not add a newline character.
}
```

## About the dot notation.

To access an identifier from a library in golang we use the library name (or alias) followed by a dot
and then the name of the identifier (functions, variables, contants, types, etc...).

Note that Go enforces encapsulation through capitalization. See the example below, or in
the directory `examples/myownlib`

```go
package mylib

// Exported function (starts with uppercase)
func Add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// Unexported function (starts with lowercase - cannot be used outside)
func subtract(a, b int) int {
    return a - b
}
```
