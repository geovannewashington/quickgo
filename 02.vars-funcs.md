# About variable declarations.

There are two kind of variable declarations in golang.

1. Explicit Declaration

Type is explicity specified.
You can use this outisde functions, at package level (global file scope).

```go
package main

var x int = 3 // Ok

func main() {
    println(x)
}
```

2. Short variable declaration

Type is infered from the value, as you can already imagine, it's not possible to delay the initialization
of a short variable.
Can only be used inside funtions.

```go
package main

func main() {
    x := 3 // type inferred as int
    println(3)
}
```

Note that if you try x := 3 outside a function, you get an error.

# About multiple return values from functions:

First of all, Go has a shorthand syntax for function parameters's type.
If all types are the same, you can omit from every paramenter but the last, see an example below:

```go
// this is the full form:
func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

// We could use the shorthand syntax:
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b // same as previous one
}
```

## Function can return multiple values in go

```go
func beyondHello() {
    var x  int
    x = 3

    y := 4

    sum, prod := learnMultiple(x, y)
    fmt.Println("sum:", sum, "prod:", prod)
}

func learnMultiple(x, y int) (sum, prod int) {
    return x + y, x * y // return two value.
}
```

In JavaScript, for instance, we could only achieve this by returning an array from a function and
applying the destructuring method.
